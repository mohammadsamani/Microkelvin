# microkelvin
Data and analysis procedures used in the microkelvin paper.

This repository only includes data files that were used for generating the figures used in the publication or in the supplementary material. The sections of the fridge temperature log files relevant to figures were downloaded.

You will need the ```h5py``` to load the data files into the Python procedures.
