Data and analysis procedures used in the paper: "Microkelvin electronics on a pulse-tube cryostat with a gate Coulomb blockade thermometer".

This repository only includes data files that were used for generating the figures used in the publication or in the supplementary material. The sections of the fridge temperature log files relevant to figures were downloaded.

You will need the ```h5py``` library to load the data files into Python procedures.
